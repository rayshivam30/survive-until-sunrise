## Features Implemented

### 1. VoiceNarrator Class (Requirement 2.1)
- ✅ Uses SpeechSynthesis API for game narration
- ✅ Optimized voice settings for horror atmosphere (slower rate, lower pitch)
- ✅ Automatic voice selection with preference for suitable voices
- ✅ Browser compatibility detection and graceful fallbacks

### 2. Dynamic Narration System (Requirement 2.2)
- ✅ Responds to player actions with contextual feedback
- ✅ Adapts to game events with appropriate emotional tone
- ✅ Fear level-based voice adjustment (faster/higher pitch for high fear)
- ✅ Time-based narration changes throughout the night
- ✅ Extensive response templates for different scenarios

### 3. Voice Feedback for Commands (Requirement 2.3)
- ✅ Command success/failure feedback with contextual responses
- ✅ Action-specific narration (hide, run, open, flashlight, listen)
- ✅ Error handling for unrecognized commands
- ✅ Integration with existing VoiceController component

### 4. Narration Queuing System (Requirement 2.4)
- ✅ Priority-based queue management (high, normal, low priority)
- ✅ Prevents overlapping speech with proper queue processing
- ✅ Interrupt capability for urgent events
- ✅ Queue status monitoring and management

### 5. Contextual Response System (Requirement 2.5)
- ✅ Game state-aware narration (fear level, time, location)
- ✅ Event-specific voice settings (whispers, urgent events)
- ✅ Multiple response variations to prevent repetition
- ✅ Emotional tone adaptation based on game context

### 6. Error Handling and Reliability (Requirement 2.6)
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing browser APIs
- ✅ Speech synthesis error recovery
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers
- ✅ Comprehensive error narration for user feedback

## Key Components

### VoiceNarrator Class Methods
- `narrate(text, options)` - Add narration to queue with priority
- `provideCommandFeedback(command, success, gameState)` - Command-specific feedback
- `narrateEvent(eventType, eventData, gameState)` - Event narration
- `narrateFearLevel(fearLevel, previousLevel)` - Fear level changes
- `narrateTimeUpdate(currentTime, gameState)` - Time progression
- `narrateGameStart()` - Game introduction
- `narrateGameEnd(victory, cause)` - Game conclusion
- `narrateError(errorType, message)` - Error feedback
- `stopCurrentNarration()` - Interrupt current speech
- `clearQueue()` - Clear all pending narration

### React Hook Integration
- `useVoiceNarrator(options)` - React hook for component integration
- State management for narration status
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount
- Callback integration for narration lifecycle events

### Response Templates
- **Game Flow**: Start, end, victory, defeat scenarios
- **Commands**: Success/failure responses for all actions
- **Events**: Footsteps, whispers, door slams, breathing
- **Fear Levels**: Low, medium, high fear responses
- **Time Updates**: Hourly progression through the night
- **Errors**: Command recognition, microphone issues

## Voice Settings Adaptation

### Fear Level Adaptation
- **Low Fear (0-39)**: Normal voice settings
- **Medium Fear (40-69)**: Slightly faster rate, higher pitch
- **High Fear (70-100)**: Much faster rate, higher pitch, urgent tone

### Event-Specific Settings
- **Whispers**: Slower rate (0.6), lower pitch (0.8), quieter volume
- **Footsteps**: Moderate pace (0.7), normal pitch
- **Door Slams**: Faster rate (1.0), higher pitch (1.1)
- **Breathing**: Very slow rate (0.5), low pitch (0.7)

### Time-Based Adaptation
- **Late Night (3-4 AM)**: Slower, lower pitch for darkest hour
- **Dawn Approach (5-6 AM)**: Faster, higher pitch for hope

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **VoiceController**: Receives command feedback through callbacks
- **GameEngine**: Provides game state for contextual narration
- **AudioManager**: Coordinates with audio for mixed feedback
- **EventSystem**: Triggers event-specific narration

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full SpeechSynthesis API support
- **Firefox**: Full support with voice selection
- **Safari**: Basic support, limited voice options
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (85+ tests)
- Initialization and configuration
- All narration methods
- Queue management and prioritization
- Voice settings adaptation
- Error handling scenarios
- Browser compatibility

### Integration Tests
- Game flow integration
- Event response handling
- Voice settings adaptation
- Performance under load
- Callback integration

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { useVoiceNarrator } from '../utils/useVoiceNarrator.js';

function GameComponent() {
  const {
    narrate,
    provideCommandFeedback,
    narrateEvent,
    narrateGameStart,
    isNarrating,
    queueLength
  } = useVoiceNarrator({
    onNarrationStart: (item) => console.log('Started:', item.text),
    onNarrationEnd: (item) => console.log('Ended:', item.text)
  });

  // Start game
  const startGame = () => {
    narrateGameStart();
  };

  // Handle command
  const handleCommand = (command, success) => {
    provideCommandFeedback(command, success, gameState);
  };

  // Handle event
  const handleEvent = (eventType) => {
    narrateEvent(eventType, { urgent: true }, gameState);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Narrating: {isNarrating ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
      <p>Queue: {queueLength} items</p>
      <button onClick={startGame}>Start Game</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Queue Management**: Efficient priority queue with O(1) insertion
- **Memory Usage**: Limited queue size and response template caching
- **Browser Resources**: Proper cleanup and cancellation of speech synthesis
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Customization**: User-selectable voice preferences
- **Language Support**: Multi-language narration templates
- **Audio Mixing**: Integration with background audio levels
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility and ARIA support
